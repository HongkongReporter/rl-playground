This is a playground for agents to learn the environments and react to it through RL.


RL libs include the effors to implement the classical SARSA, ONPI, RMAX algorithms, and we evaluate in the openai gym.

Deep RL algorithms implementation is also included, the main reference is Sergey Levine's https://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/ Deep RL course.
